## Welcome to the Data Systems Group (DSG) @ Polytechnique Montréal

**DSG** is a research group specializing in all aspects of data and information management research at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/), an engineering school affiliated with [Université de Montréal (UdeM)](https://www.umontreal.ca/) in [Montréal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal), [Québec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec), Canada. 

<!--Our research focuses on the foundations of analytical data management systems to ***empower individuals and organizations to easily make sense of their varying datasets at scale***. We develop systems for different phases of the data management cycle with a focus on: i) data preparation; ii) querying heterogeneous datasets; iii) interactive knowledge management; and iv) visual data interfaces. Within these phases, we research performance considerations in query execution and optimization, debuggability and tracing, data interface design, and higher-level applications. Finally, we highly value deployments to end users of all technical levels.-->
