## Data Systems Group (DSG) @ Polytechnique

We are a research group specializing in all aspects of data and information management research at [Polytechnique Montr√©al](https://www.polymtl.ca/gigl/) in [Qu√©bec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec), Canada. 

Our research focuses on the foundations of analytical data management systems to ***empower individuals to easily make sense of their varying datasets at scale***. We develop systems for different phases of the data management cycle with a focus on: i) data preparation; ii) querying heterogeneous datasets; iii) interactive knowledge management; and iv) visual data interfaces. Within these phases, we research performance considerations in query execution and optimization, debuggability and tracing, data interface design, and higher-level applications. Finally, we highly value deployments to end users at all technical levels.
